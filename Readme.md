# Fusion Calculator for Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories

An app with tkinter ui designed to make fusions more accesible, by showing the user
possible monster combinations, doesn't show equip cards however.

Designed to be used with Duckstation emulator, on the USA version of the game. Likely
to fail with other versions.

## Usage

When the program runs it will ask for a `base address`. This can be obtained in the 
`Memory Scanner` available in the emulator.
